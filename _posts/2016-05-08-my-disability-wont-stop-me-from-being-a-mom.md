<article style=""><h1>My Disability Won't Stop Me from Being a Mom</h1><p>Valeria Rodriguez Fontenla never doubted that she would one day become a mother. "I believed it would happen when I was 29 or 30 but one day someone read my future and said: 'You will give birth to a female, earlier than you expect.'"

> Today, Valeria is an independent 29-year-old mother, teacher and biologist who works and takes care of her daughter with the help of her caregiver. And, although she uses a wheelchair and requires 24-hour care, she also travels, dances, swims and takes great joy in watching two-year-old Lourdes as she begins to walk and discover the world around her.
