The Argo Trust is
basically named after this amazing place in an island down under (and don't you
dare think Australia) called "The Argo Trust".

Well, where do we
begin about the good ol Argo. Well first, Argo is where many people from all
around the world called home. Though it is home to the world's best, it was
exclusively built for SIX wonderful residents. What made them wonderful is the
life that they live, despite challenged with profound intellectual and physical
disabilities. 

What brings meaning
to Argo is its residents. They are the reason why a few amazing people from
across the globe wake up in the morning feeling psyched to get to work. So it
is important to know them.

Well lets introduce them now shall we. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/10e879b7-5a08-4352-aea7-ac4efb1ca778.jpg)
